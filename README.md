## About The project

The main project of NASA Space App Challenge [Spot That Fire!](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/volcanoes-icebergs-and-asteroids-oh-my/real-time-fire-app/details) 

I thought about that kind of project for long and I'm so happy that NASA proposed to implement it. 
And I hope it would be useful for the others and I'm always open for contribution to it.

# The Space App Challenge

**NASA:**
> Build a crowdsourcing tool for citizens to contribute to early detection, verification, tracking, visualization, and notification of wildfires.

## Plans
_sorted by priority_

- **Make app accessible for developers**
  - Provide a brief description of the app or solution goal and design â€“ what does it do and how
  - Offer the description (a story) of why this app or solution is important and what insights or future capabilities it provides with regard to fighting wildfires
- **Make app mobile friendly**
  - web
  - mobile app (react native) [#18](/../../issues/18)
- **Track and visualize fire**
  - stream of fires near my [#4](/../../issues/4)
  - realtime map [#5](/../../issues/5)
  - realtime stream [#6](/../../issues/6)
- **Report a fire**
  - I see a fire (+ few categories of wildness) + location, text message, attach photo [#9](/../../issues/9)
  - send tweet with images, message and location about fire [#7](/../../issues/7)
  - send fb message (bot) [#8](/../../issues/8)
  - share from other sources 
- **Notify communities at risk**
  - subscribe on fire alarm near your [#10](/../../issues/10)
  - give API to subscribe to fire incidents
- **Build mashups**
  - merge with NASA data (Leverage NASA state-of-the-art technology, including: near-real-time fire database and satellite image processing APIs accessible through the NASA OpenNEX App Store) [#11](/../../issues/11)
  - add information about weather
  - listen twitter, instagram, fb and show related warnings
- **Community/Social**
  - create user's profile [#12](/../../issues/12)

  - report on message
- **Verify and screen fire reports**
  - validate crowd data
- **Gamification**
  - scores for successful actions  [#14](/../../issues/14)
  - badges for reported fires, for saved people and etc
  - could become local "fire marshal" if one is good lifeguard
  - ask about fire activity near you and give rewards on help
- **Analysis and prediction**
  - analyze and predict fire based on other data (weather)
- **Other**
  - localization [#15](/../../../issues/15)
